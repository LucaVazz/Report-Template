Amadeus has millions of problem records stored in a global database, too many for a person or even a team to search through. Currently available tools to search the database are not adequate for quick and easy searches. As a result of this, the valuable information in the database becomes inaccessible as there is simply too much noise. That is the root cause for many duplicated or wrongly assigned new problem records: Teams don't know what others are doing exactly. This tends to increase the time until a problem is resolved and therefore decreases overall customer satisfaction.

The following paper will show how the the proposed solution called ``{\reporttitle}'' tries to solve this problem as a Twitter-like facade in front of the problem database allowing developers and product managers to easily query the problems using short annotated messages.
